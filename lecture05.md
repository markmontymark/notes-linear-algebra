# PA = LU

# Vector Spaces and Subspaces


## PA = LU

Permutations P: execute row exchanges

    P-1 = Pt   ==   Pt * P = I

## Transpose

Example:

     |1 3|
     |2 3| who's transpose is |1 2 4|
     |4 1|                    |3 3 1|

A symmetric matrix is one where A == At


    Rt * R is always symmetric


## Vector Spaces and Subspaces


    R₂ = all 2 dimensional, real vectors
       = x,y plane, must have [0 0] vector (the origin)
    
    R₃ = all 3 dimensional, real vectors
       = all vectors w/ 3 components
    
       = above we mean column vectors (not row vectors)
    

Subspaces of R₂
1. all of R₂
2. any line thru the origin, |0| L
                             |0|  
3. zero vector only, subspace Z

All the column combinations (linear combinations) 
form a subspace, and its 
called a column space, C(A)
