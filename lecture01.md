    2x - y = 0
    -x + 2y = 3
    
    Coefficient matrix
    
     |2 -1| |x| = |0|
     |-1 2| |y|   |3|
    
         A   x  =  b
    
    The row picture: 
    - draw each graph (the line, 2x - y = 0, and the line -x + 2y = 3)
    - Solution is x = 1, y = 2 because upon graphing each equation, the lines intersect (only once) at x = 1, y = 2
    
    The column picture:
    
      x | 2|  +  y|-1|  =  |0|
        |-1|      | 2|     |3|
    
    
    |2 5| times |1|  =  |12|
    |1 3|       [2]  =  | 7|
    
    because the dot product,
    
    |(2 * 1) + (5 * 2)| = |12|
    |(1 * 1) + (3 * 2)|   | 7|
    
    or written another way, the column way,
    
    
    1 * |2|  +  2 * |5|  = |(1*2) + (2*5)|  =  |12|
        |1|         |3|    |(1*1) + (2*3)|  =  | 7|
    
    Those are examples of matrix mulitplication, or dot product.
